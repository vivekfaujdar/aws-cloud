what?
  Basically, you rent a virtual server in aws to 
1. Instance = running copy->  Yes, an instance is basically a running copy of something (like an object in Java is a running copy of its class definition).

2. EC2 instance = copy of what?
  An EC2 instance is a running copy of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
so what's AMI = the blueprint/template. It includes:
  The Operating System (Linux, Windows, etc.)
  Pre-installed software (if you want, e.g., MySQL, Apache, Docker)

Configuration details.
EC2 Instance = one live, running “copy” of that AMI, backed by CPU, memory, storage, and networking from AWS’s physical servers.

3. Not exactly a copy of GPU/OS
  It’s not a copy of a GPU (though you can attach GPUs to EC2 instances).
  It’s not just a copy of an OS, but rather a copy of a full virtual machine image (OS + environment + configuration).

can i make an instance without AMI? or is it a prerequisite to make it?
  No, you cannot launch an EC2 instance without an AMI (or some kind of boot template).

Why?
Every instance needs to know: Which operating system to run (Linux, Windows, etc.). Which initial software/configurations should be there. That “blueprint” is the Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

But…

You have a few options:
  Use AWS-provided AMIs – e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows.
  Use community/marketplace AMIs – pre-configured with tools like WordPress, MySQL, etc.
  Create your own custom AMI – if you want your own setup baked in.
  Launch from a snapshot – even here, AWS still wraps it as an AMI under the hood.

So an EC2 instance is not purely an “instance of an AMI.” It’s more precise to say: ✅ An EC2 instance is a running virtual machine created from an AMI and additional launch configurations.

Other Configurations (not part of AMI) 
When you launch an EC2 instance, you need more than just the OS. You decide:
1. Instance type → how much CPU, RAM, GPU, etc.
2. Storage (EBS volumes) → how big the disk is, SSD/HDD, etc.
3. Networking (VPC, subnet, security group, IP) → where the instance lives and how it connects.
4. IAM Role → what permissions the instance has.
5. User data → startup scripts. (only runs once at first start)
6. Key pair → login credentials.
