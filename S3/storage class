Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) offers multiple storage classes designed for different use cases, balancing cost, availability, durability, and retrieval times.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main S3 storage classes:


---

1. S3 Standard

Use case: Frequently accessed data.

Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines).

Availability: 99.99%.

Cost: Highest among S3 classes.

Retrieval: Immediate.

Examples: Websites, mobile apps, content delivery.



---

2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Use case: Data with unknown or changing access patterns.

How it works: Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on usage.

Cost: Small monitoring fee, but saves cost by automatic tiering.

Retrieval: Immediate.



---

3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

Use case: Data accessed less frequently, but needs quick access when required.

Durability: 11 nines.

Availability: 99.9%.

Cost: Cheaper than Standard, but retrieval cost applies.

Examples: Backups, disaster recovery.



---

4. S3 One Zone-IA

Use case: Infrequently accessed data that can be recreated if lost.

Durability: 11 nines, but stored in a single AZ (lower resilience).

Availability: 99.5%.

Cost: Lower than Standard-IA.

Examples: Secondary backups, easily reproducible data.



---

5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

Use case: Archival data that is rarely accessed, but needs millisecond retrieval.

Durability: 11 nines.

Availability: 99.9%.

Cost: Very low storage cost + retrieval fee.

Examples: Medical images, user-generated content archives.



---

6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier)

Use case: Long-term archival where retrieval times can be minutes to hours.

Retrieval options:

Expedited: 1â€“5 minutes.

Standard: 3â€“5 hours.

Bulk: 5â€“12 hours.


Cost: Cheaper than Glacier Instant.



---

7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Use case: Lowest-cost storage for long-term data retention (like tape archives).

Retrieval times: Hours (Standard: 12 hours, Bulk: 48 hours).

Cost: Cheapest storage option.

Examples: Compliance archives, government records.



---

8. S3 Outposts

Use case: For workloads that need S3 on-premises (AWS Outposts).

Durability & availability: Same as S3 in the region but deployed locally.
