USER-BASED-> IAM
  IAM ACCESS ANALYZER for s3: insures only intended people have access to your s3 buckets

RESORCE-BASED:
  bucket policy: JSON based policy
  object access control list
  bucket acl

ENCRYPTION: using encryption keys
  1. server side encryption (by dafault)
  2. client side encryption done on client by the client
both are ava in aws

NOTE: an IAM principal can access if IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resources policy allows it AND there's no explicit DENY
