Basically an object storage service (not file storage like in traditional system)

Data is stored as objects in buckets

Is it a global service? --- NO its a regional service, buckets are created in a specific aws region

Is it serverless? -- yes. why ? -- bcz you don't have to manage any unlying infra for it. what does that mean... that's means. you don't choose ec2 instances for it, it scales automatically, it even trigger events like lambda etcc

USED FOR:
  HOsting a static website
  backup and restore
  big data for analytics
  data lake for machine learning
    wtf is that? it's a centralised storage repository that stores all structured, semi structured and unstructured data in it's raw form, at any scale. s3 integrates with tools like Athena, glue, emr redshift for analytics. 

CORE FEATURES:
  Durability: 99.99999999999% (11 nines)
    means howmany times an object is going to be lost by aws s3
    if you store 1,00,00,000(10 million) objects oyou can on avg expect to incur loss of single object once every 10,000 years
  Ava: highly available, varies depending on staorage class
  Scalability: virtually unlimited storage
  Storage classes: 
      standard
      intellgent tiering
      standard IA (infrequent access)
      Glacier
  versioning
  Lifecycle rules: automate moving data to cheaper storage
  Access Control: you can make data private ublic restricted with fine-grainied permissions; through bucket policy, iam policy, Block Public Access, Encryption
  Data consistancy: Strong read-after-write consistency
  Replication: same region or cross region, must enable versioning

PAYING MODEL:
  pay for storage used; Requests(put,get,list); Data transfer out (to internet or other region)
