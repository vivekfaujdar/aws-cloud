it is a data-transfer service, not a part of s3 but highly integraed with s3
which uses physical hardware appliances to move large amounts of data in and out of aws.

why used ?
  large scale datamigration
  bandwidth limitation
  edge computing
  disaster recovery and backups
  data transfer out of aws

SNOW FAMILY:
  1. snowcone: smallest 8tb, suitable for small scale data transfer or edge computing but not ideal for petabytes 
  2. storage optimised: for large scale data migrations, provides high capacity storage petayte scale; offers local computing, enabling processing of data at edge before transfering it to aws 
  3. compute optimised: high perormance computing workload; not primarily for the data transfer but comppute intensive tasks at athe edge 
  4. snow mobile: a truck sized data ceter on wheels to move exabytes of data; doest provide local computing capacity.

NOTE: data transfer IN to amazon S3 is free.
