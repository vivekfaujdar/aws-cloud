What is Amazon Redshift?

Fully managed data warehouse service in AWS.

Designed for online analytical processing (OLAP) → analyzing large amounts of structured/semi-structured data.

Uses columnar storage (fast for queries over large datasets).

Built on top of PostgreSQL (but optimized for analytics, not transactional workloads).

Key Features

Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) → splits queries across many nodes for speed.

Columnar storage → stores data by column, not row, making it efficient for aggregations and analytics.

Integration → works with S3, Glue, Kinesis, QuickSight, Athena, etc.

Scalability → can handle petabytes of data.

Cost-effective → pay only for what you use, also supports Redshift Serverless.

Redshift Spectrum → lets you query data directly in S3 without loading it first.

Security → VPC, encryption, IAM, auditing.

Use Cases

Business intelligence & reporting.

Big data analytics.

Data lake integration (with S3).

ETL (extract, transform, load) pipelines.

Exam Tip (AWS Practitioner / Associate)

If you see:

“Need to analyze petabytes of structured data using SQL” → Redshift.

“Need fast queries on transactional/operational data” → RDS/Aurora.

“Need to query data directly from S3 using SQL (no warehouse)” → Athena.

“Need to build dashboards/visualizations” → QuickSight.

⚡ Shortcut to remember:

RDS/DynamoDB → OLTP (transactional, real-time apps).

Redshift → OLAP (analytics, reporting, big data).

Do you want me to also create a comparison table: Redshift vs RDS vs DynamoDB, so you can clearly see where each one fits for exams?
