In AWS, ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service that helps speed up applications by reducing the load on databases and improving response times.

It mainly supports two open-source caching engines:

Redis → A powerful in-memory key-value store that supports advanced data structures, pub/sub messaging, persistence, clustering, and replication.

Memcached → A simpler, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system (good for straightforward caching use cases).
