ðŸ”‘ Key Points about AWS DMS:

1. Purpose

Used to migrate data from one database to another.

Supports homogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle â†’ Oracle) and heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle â†’ MySQL, SQL Server â†’ Aurora).



2. Minimal Downtime

DMS keeps the source database operational during migration.

It continuously replicates changes (Change Data Capture â€“ CDC) until cutover.



3. Source & Target Databases Supported

Sources: On-prem databases, RDS, EC2-hosted DBs, S3, etc.

Targets: Amazon RDS, Aurora, Redshift, DynamoDB, S3, Kinesis, etc.



4. Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

If you migrate between different engines (heterogeneous), you may need AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to convert schema & SQL code.



5. Replication Types

Full Load â†’ One-time migration of existing data.

Full Load + CDC â†’ Migrate existing data + keep syncing changes.

CDC Only â†’ Migrate ongoing changes (useful for real-time replication).



6. Serverless (managed)

AWS manages replication instances (you just choose size).

Handles failover, scaling, monitoring.
