A fully managed NoSQL database service in AWS.

Stores data as key–value pairs and documents.

Serverless – you don’t manage servers, AWS handles scaling, replication, backups.

Key Features

NoSQL → Not relational, doesn’t use SQL joins or schemas.

Fast & scalable → Single-digit millisecond latency, scales automatically to handle millions of requests per second.

Highly available → Data is automatically replicated across multiple AZs in a region.

Flexible schema → Each item in a table doesn’t need to have the same attributes.

Integration with Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis, etc. → good for serverless apps.

Global Tables → Multi-region replication for worldwide apps.

Streams → Capture changes in real time (good for event-driven apps).
