AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
Global service

root account created by default shouldnt be used or shared

users-> people in organisation, can be grouped
Groups cant contain other groups
users can belong to multiple groups

users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
policy structure:
  Version
  Id
  Statement
    Sid
    Effect :  Allow/Deny
    Principle: user/account/role
    Action
    Resource  
Policy at group level will be inherited by all users in a group
Least privilage principle -> dont give more permission than user needs

To access AWS, three options:
  1. aws management console, protected by password
  2. aws CLI, protected by access keys
        direct access to public apis of aws services
        can develop scripts to manage your resources

  3. asw SDK, for code/programming, by access key
        embedded within application
        enables access programatically
        language specific apis

access keys are managed by users, created from console.
